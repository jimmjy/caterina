		'Those are a whole lot of buzz-words, but what does it mean?',
		"Okay, let's break it down. Firstly, let's start with the \"create and connect\" part. Some of your best traits are living somewhere under the surface, getting lost in other people's ideas of who you are, expectations that are placed on you, fitting into some sort of mould. Together, we will work on dissolving those aspects, so that you can connect to the elements of yourself that are true. Other parts of you may not be fully discovered yet. Maybe there are places where you're not reaching your full potential; maybe you've never really thought about what your life could be like if you weren't affected by anxiety, depression or other similar issues; maybe you're having trouble within the constructs of a relationship in your life. These are the aspects that we can create together.",
		"What does the authentic version of yourself look like? Together, we'll explore your personal values, goals, dreams, strengths, likes, dislikes - and we'll work on breaking down obstacles that are in your way - as you strive to become the version of yourself that you want to be.",

			'holistic - this means that I consider all the factors that contribute to your current state, using the entire biopsychosocial sphere. I like to pay particular attention to the social aspect, and how outward forces influence your inner life. Things like societal pressures, socioeconomic status, race, sex and gender, spirituality, family, work, and all other contributors to your overall wellness and wellbeing. ',
			'mindful - mindfulness is a present-moment awareness of our thoughts, our feelings, our bodies, and our environment. I will encourage you to experience these sensations without judgement to cultivate an understanding of what is happening in the here-and-now.',
			'evidence-based - I use techniques from evidence-based modalities, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, solution-focused therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and others, in order to create customized interventions to help you achieve your goals.',
