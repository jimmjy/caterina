      "It’s normal to feel some anxiety in life, especially in times of change or turbulence. Anxiety is a natural response to not knowing what’s coming. But when anxiety becomes overwhelming, and worrying starts taking over your life, there are steps you can take to get some relief. ",
      "Anxiety is rooted in the body, and many times, it’s out of our conscious control. It may be rooted in past trauma. It may be holding you back from achieving your dreams. Anxiety can include generalized anxiety, social anxiety and panic disorder, as well as specific fears and phobias. ",
      "Let’s talk about it. Together, we’ll help discover where your anxiety is coming from, and how to find the strength you need to cope with uncertainty. ",

      "Depression affects not only our day-to-day moods, but can also have a significant impact on our overall worldview and outlook on life. If you find yourself experiencing lower motivation, less interest or deriving less pleasure from activities you used to enjoy, experiencing changes in mood or appetite, feeling defeated or hopeless about your current situation or your future, it may be a good time to chat with a psychotherapist. ",
      "Together, we can explore coping strategies that will help you create a more balanced outlook on life. We will work on different approaches to improve your daily life, at home, work, school and in relationships. ",

    description: [
      "Do you struggle with feelings of unworthiness, or a lack of confidence? Do you base your feelings of confidence around your looks, around what you’ve achieved, or around what material possessions you own? It’s very common in our society to base our self-worth on external factors – but external factors can be fleeting. What seems great one day can disappear the next, taking your entire sense of self-worth with it. ",
      "If you’re ready to address your self-worth, together, we’ll work on finding value in yourself, acknowledging both your strengths and your flaws – because all of your characteristics make you who you are. Together, we’ll help you find your sense of worthiness, encompassing everything that makes you, you, and help you see that you are enough, just the way you are. ",

Relationships that impact our lives on a daily basis can include romantic partners, parents or other family members, coworkers, friends, and more. ",
      "If a relationship is affecting your well-being, psychotherapy can help you explore issues within your relationships. Topics we can explore include: family and relationship history, personal relationship patterns, defining and setting boundaries, specific behaviours and negative or difficult emotions. If these topics resonate, give me a call and let’s chat about it. ",

    title: "Stress Management",
    description: [
      "High levels of stress can make it difficult to cope with daily responsibilities, think clearly, and enjoy life. While stress is a natural part of life, when it becomes chronic, or increasingly present, it can cause long-term health problems, in the mental, physical or emotional realms. If you feel an increasing level of stress, it is important to first seek help from your medical doctor to rule out any physical contributors to your symptoms of stress. A doctor may then mention seeking the help of a psychotherapist to help create a customized plan for stress management. ",
      "If you are ready to seek help for stress management, together we can work on strategies such as boundary setting, planning, recognizing unhelpful thought patterns and focusing techniques, while also working on uncovering and addressing the underlying causes of the stress. ",
